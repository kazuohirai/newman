#Overview
Newman is the Alert Manager for the MPEG-4 Conversion Program.  It stores information about customers and their devices which need to be upgraded.  That information is used to send alerts to those devices, notifying customers of the Conversion Program.

The Conversion Program divides customers into two categories: those who are eligible for an X1 or triple-play upsell, and those who are not.  Newman refers to this as triplePlayEligibility.  Different alerts are sent to customers based on which category they fall under.

### DevGuide for setting up Newman on local machine

+ Step 1: Run Vagrant ELK-Stack
  + Clone â€“ vagrant project locally from https://github.comcast.com/CPT/vagrant
  + cd vagrat/elk
  + vagrant up
  + Make sure that elasticsearch is running at http://locahost:9200/

+ Step 2: Setup Newman index on your local Elasticsearch
  + In a terminal, change to the Newman model module and cd to src/main/resources/com/comcast/cpt/c3po/newman/model/elasticsearch/
  + Deploy the Newman template file to Elasticsearch, so the index will have the correct mappings:
    + curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/_template/newman -d@template.json
  + Create a newman index from elasticsearch
    + curl -XPOST http://locahost:9200/newman
  + Bulk import seeddata.json (com/comcast/cpt/c3po/newman/model/elasticsearch/seeddata.json)
    + curl -XPOST http://locahost:9200/newman/_bulk --data-binary @seeddata.json

+ Step 3: Make sure that you're using Corporate-LDAP by checking these settings:
  + newman.security.active.directory.enabled is set to false in newman-web-default.properties
  + newman.security.active.directory.enabled is set to false from web/pom.xml's system properties.
